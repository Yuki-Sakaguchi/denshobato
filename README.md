# Denshobato

A Raycast extension that helps avoid garbled characters and input errors when using IME (Input Method Editor). Denshobato provides a dedicated input form that sends text directly to the focused application while also saving it to your clipboard.

## Features

- **Smart Text Input**: Enter text in a dedicated form that bypasses IME-related issues
- **Direct Application Integration**: Automatically sends text to the currently focused application
- **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically saves text to your clipboard for backup and convenience
- **Fallback Support**: Gracefully handles permission issues with multiple fallback methods
- **Cross-Application Compatible**: Works with any application that accepts text input

## How It Works

1. **Launch Denshobato** from Raycast
2. **Enter your text** in the provided text area
3. **Submit** - Denshobato will:
   - Attempt to paste text directly to the focused application using Raycast's clipboard API
   - If direct paste fails, use AppleScript to simulate Cmd+V keystroke
   - Always save the text to your clipboard as a backup
   - Restore your original clipboard content after operation

## Installation

Install Denshobato from the [Raycast Store](https://www.raycast.com/store).

1. Open Raycast
2. Search for "Denshobato" in the extensions
3. Click "Install Extension"

Alternatively, you can search for "Denshobato" directly in Raycast and install it from the search results.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
- Open Raycast and search for "Denshobato" or "Write a letter"
- Enter your text in the text area
- Press Enter or click Submit
- The text will be sent to the focused application

### Permission Requirements
- **Accessibility Access**: Required for AppleScript automation
- If accessibility permissions are not granted, Denshobato will still copy text to your clipboard with a notification
